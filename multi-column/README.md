# Multi-Column Email

Multiple columns that are stacked when needed, with normal and high pixel density assets, and negative margins causing overlap into parent's sibling containers.

Note: High pixel density assets, apart from the header graphic, are marked with a red ```[R]```. Because of the negligible file size differences between some of the high and normal density assets, some of the higher density images are used even if the device does not support more than 1.5 pixel ratio.

## Designs

Two designs were made -- one for viewing at > 600 pixel window width, and one for < 600.
