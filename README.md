# HTML Email Examples

Since I have to write them from time to time, but not all of the time, the layouts in this repo are meant to be a reference point. Starting with just one layout, I incorporated all the elements that I have had to create in HTML emails in the past.

- [multi-column](multi-column/)
	- Columns are stacked when there isn't enough horizontal space.
	- Images are switched with their high-density equivalents using media queries.
	- Negative margins for some graphics to make them overflow into their parent's previous sibling.
